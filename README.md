# Hello, my name is Adam Saunders! 🩻🧠

👋 Hi, I'm Adam Saunders, a PhD student at Vanderbilt University in the **MASI Lab**. My work focuses on **medical imaging research**, aiming to use **deep learning** to estimate missing information from imperfectly acquired data.

## ✨ Highlights
- 🧠 **MRI and the Brain**: My work focuses on MRI, particularly on diffusion MRI in the brain in the context of minor traumatic brain injury.
- 📊 **AI & Machine Learning**: I leverage deep learning to build **robust, accessible, and accurate medical imaging tools**.
- 🩻 **Maintainer of OpenDIVE**: I am a maintainer of [OpenDIVE](https://github.com/MASILab/open_dive) with [@ElyssaMcMaster](https://github.com/ElyssaMcMaster), a diffusion MRI visualization tool aimed at accessibility and ease of use created during [BrainHack Vanderbilt 2025](https://brainhack-vandy.github.io/).
